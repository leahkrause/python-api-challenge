# WEATHERPY

#For the first section of the project, load in all dependencies and import the OpenWeatherMap API key

#Generate the cities list using the citipy library. Create two empty lists, one for the latitude and longitude combinations and one for the cities names. Set a latitude range and a longitude range. Create a random list of latitude and longitude combinations using np.random. Identify the nearest cities to these location points and append the unique cities to a list. 

#Requirement 1: Create plots to showcase the relationship between weather variables and latitude. 

#Loop through all the cities in the previous list and attain the weather information (Max Temperature, Humitidy, Clouds, Wind Speed, Country, and Date) from the OpenWeather API. 

#Convert this weather data into a DataFrame and export this to a CSV. Save the CSV to the output file. 

#Create scatter plots showcasing the following relationships: Latitude vs. Temperature, Latitude vs. Humidity, Latitude vs. Cloudiness, and Latitude vs. Wind Speed. 

#Requirement 2: Compute linear regressions for each relationship. 

#Define a function to create a linear regression plot. 

#Create two DataFrames, one with the Northern Hemisphere Data and one with the Southern Hemisphere Data.

#Use the earlier defined function to create seperate linear regression plots for the Northern Hemisphere Data and the Southern Hemisphere Data for the following relationships: Temperature vs. Latitude, Humidity vs. Latitude, Cloudiness vs. Latitude, and Wind Speed vs. Latitude. 

# VACATION PY

#First, load in dependencies and OpenWeatherMap API key. Next, load in the CSV file created in Part 1. 

#Plot the cities from the CSV on a map.

#Narrow down the city data to cities with the ideal weather â€“ humidity under 70%, max temperature under 80 degrees and cloudiness under 20. 

#Drop any null values in this new DataFrame (ideal_weather_df).

#Copy this DataFrame into a reduced DataFrame called hotel_df that only includes the city, country, latitude, longitude, and humidity. 

#Add a new empty column to hotel_df that will be filled with the nearest hotel name attained from the API.

#For each city on the list, use the API to find the first hotel located within 10,000 metres of the coordinates. To do this, set parameters (radius, categories, limit, filters, and bias) to search for a hotel and iterate through the hotel_df rows. Request the data from the API and convert it to a JSON format. Take the first hotel name from the results and input it into the empty column made for the hotel names in the hotel_df. 

#Finally, display these results on a map with the hotel name and country displayed when hovering on the points.
